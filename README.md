### How to access Helios Examples 

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the Helios Examples GitHub Repository.
   
NOTE: GitHub is a platform for hosting and sharing code, and this repository contains sample code and examples for Helios smart contracts.

2. Clone the Repository Locally
   
To work with the examples on your local machine:

a. Install Git: If you don’t have Git installed, download and install it from git-scm.com.

b. Open Terminal or Command Prompt: Run the following command:git clone https://github.com/lley154/helios-examples.git

Look for a folder named nft. This folder contains files related to minting an NFT on Cardano using Helios. To switch to this directory, open your terminal and run the following command: cd nft

Inside the folder, you will find Helios script files (.helios or .hs) that demonstrate the logic for NFT minting.

2. Open the Project in Visual Studio Code
